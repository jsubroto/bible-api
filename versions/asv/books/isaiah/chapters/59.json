{"version":"ASV","book":"Isaiah","chapter":"59","verses":[{"verse":1,"text":"Behold, Jehovah\u2019s hand is not shortened, that it cannot save; neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear: "},{"verse":2,"text":"but your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, so that he will not hear. "},{"verse":3,"text":"For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue muttereth wickedness. "},{"verse":4,"text":"None sueth in righteousness, and none pleadeth in truth: they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity. "},{"verse":5,"text":"They hatch adders\u2019 eggs, and weave the spider\u2019s web: he that eateth of their eggs dieth; and that which is crushed breaketh out into a viper. "},{"verse":6,"text":"Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover themselves with their works: their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands. "},{"verse":7,"text":"Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and destruction are in their paths. "},{"verse":8,"text":"The way of peace they know not; and there is no justice in their goings: they have made them crooked paths; whosoever goeth therein doth not know peace."},{"verse":9,"text":"Therefore is justice far from us, neither doth righteousness overtake us: we look for light, but, behold, darkness; for brightness, but we walk in obscurity. "},{"verse":10,"text":"We grope for the wall like the blind; yea, we grope as they that have no eyes: we stumble at noonday as in the twilight; among them that are lusty we are as dead men. "},{"verse":11,"text":"We roar all like bears, and moan sore like doves: we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off from us. "},{"verse":12,"text":"For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them: "},{"verse":13,"text":"transgressing and denying Jehovah, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood. "},{"verse":14,"text":"And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness standeth afar off; for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter. "},{"verse":15,"text":"Yea, truth is lacking; and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey."},{"verse":15,"text":"And Jehovah saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice. "},{"verse":16,"text":"And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor: therefore his own arm brought salvation unto him; and his righteousness, it upheld him.
