"},{"verse":3,"text":"But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God. "},{"verse":4,"text":"Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoreth his head. "},{"verse":5,"text":"But every woman praying or prophesying with her head unveiled dishonoreth her head; for it is one and the same thing as if she were shaven. "},{"verse":6,"text":"For if a woman is not veiled, let her also be shorn: but if it is a shame to a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be veiled. "},{"verse":7,"text":"For a man indeed ought not to have his head veiled, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. "},{"verse":8,"text":"For the man is not of the woman; but the woman of the man: "},{"verse":9,"text":"for neither was the man created for the woman; but the woman for the man: "},{"verse":10,"text":"for this cause ought the woman to have a sign of authority on her head, because of the angels. "},{"verse":11,"text":"Nevertheless, neither is the woman without the man, nor the man without the woman, in the Lord. "},{"verse":12,"text":"For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman; but all things are of God.

"},{"verse":14,"text":"Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a dishonor to him? "},{"verse":15,"text":"But if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her: for her hair is given her for a covering. "},{"verse":16,"text":"But if any man seemeth to be contentious, we have no such custom, neither the churches of God."},{"verse":17,"text":"But in giving you this charge, I praise you not, that ye come together not for the better but for the worse. "},{"verse":18,"text":"For first of all, when ye come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and I partly believe it. "},{"verse":19,"text":"For there must be also factions among you, that they that are approved may be made manifest among you. "},{"verse":20,"text":"When therefore ye assemble yourselves together, it is not possible to eat the Lord\u2019s supper: "},{"verse":21,"text":"for in your eating each one taketh before other his own supper; and one is hungry, and another is drunken. "},{"verse":22,"text":"What, have ye not houses to eat and to drink in? or despise ye the church of God, and put them to shame that have not? What shall I say to you? shall I praise you? In this I praise you not.

"},{"verse":32,"text":"But when we are judged, we are chastened of the Lord, that we may not be condemned with the world.
